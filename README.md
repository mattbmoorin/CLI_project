# IPDETECTIVE

A simple CLI app using the Shodan API to return information pertaining to the target IP address.

To use this on your machine you will need your own Shodan API Key.

After cloning the repo, run bundle install, insert your Key using API.rb and start the program using the run file.

For now, the first "level" of data retrieval is a list of items related to the target IP address.

Select an item from the list using the on-screen instructions to advance to the 2nd level of data.
